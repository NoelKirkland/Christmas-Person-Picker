# Kirkland Christmas Picker

### By Noel R. Kirkland - 1/3/2021

### Kirkland Christmas Picker is a React web application. It's genesis is kind of a funny story. For the last 20 years my family has had a Christmas tradition. We each create a homemade Christmas gift for someone in our family. At the beginning of each year we all pick names from a hat. The name you pick will be the person who you make this gift for and give to them the following Christmas. Every Christmas we all get together and exchange these homemade gifts with the person we selected from the hat. We've had funny gifts, we've had very sentimental gifts, and we've have incredibly impressive gifts.
This has always been a fun tradition but, a little tricky and chaotic to actually pick the names out of the hat at the beginning of each year. See, there are a few restrictions during the selection process. You cannot pick somebody from your household family, and you can't pick the person you had the year prior. Since there's no good way to insure these two rules when you're simple picking names out of a hat there always seems to be a lot of picking and putting back. Plus, you're never sure if they are putting the name back because of the rules or if they just didn't want that particular family member. 
This web application solves all of that. All family members are stored in a database and devided by household. After one of the family signs into the application they will pick from two drop down menus: 1. Their own name, and 2. who they had last year. Once they have entered these they will push **Christmas Picker Button** and a randomly generated name will be picked from the data base and displayed on the screen. This person will be the one who you will make a gift for and give them the following Christmas.
